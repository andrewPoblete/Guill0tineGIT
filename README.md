# Guillotine
The revolutionary card game where you win by getting a head

Interactive and animated game based on the card game of the same name where you win by beheading the highest point nobles. Created in about 2-3 weeks as the final project for the General Assembly Front End Web Development course using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Currently, 2 player mechanism forces players to play on the same computer and full deck functionality is missing.

##To Do

1. Integrate additional cards for more complicated moves.
2. Scoring mechanism to add or subtract points depending on cards you own.
3. Possible real time 2 player integration using Firebase.
